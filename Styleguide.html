          <h1> With the overall color palette for my website I thought having warm and cool hues combined to create a colorful yet not overwhelming feeling. I think the appeal came from how it created a very youthful and modern design. The light greens and earthy terracottas I think work to create a nice contrast that isn't too agressive.  </h1>

<h1> The two images above are screenshots of two websites whose color palettes I found to be very engaging and interesting. I liked how despite the colors being almost completely different they evoke this sense of unision and harmony through how different they are. </h1>

<h1>I came across this website through following YouTube tutorials around 3D modelling, as the website's creator is a 3D artist. The website is extremely simple and minimalistic, I liked the fact that the bright green was contrasted against the the black text. </H1>

    <h1>Above is the website that the bare bones of my designs originate from, partially because I followed a tutorial which helped build that site, and also because I just felt like the site was modern, sleek and retained a edge of professionalism despite feeling fun as well. </H1>

            <h1> This was the very first iteration of my website. It was very crude and basic with hardly any details.  I envisioned it having a log-in & sign-up screen. I also began thinking about how the website would look on a mobile device.</H1>
        
                <img class = "StyleGuidePage" src="HomepageWireframe.jpg" alt="Styleguide thumbnails go here!">

            <h1>This is the first wireframe I drafted after seeing the tutorial. With it I wanted to bring my own spin to the website and making it mine instead of just using the tutorial. Additionally, I thought some aspects would not be suited to what I wanted to do. </h1> 

            <img class = "StyleGuidePage" src="BlogWireframe.jpg" alt="Styleguide thumbnails go here!">

            <h1> I think this took me the longer to plot out and implement than I intially thought, because there were so many options to choose from, and it was not easy to find the exact one that I needed. However, the most difficult aspect, would definitely be how I needed conceptualize how a blog would look like and how I could fit it into my website.</h1>

            <img class = "StyleGuidePage" src="PortfolioWireframe.jpg" alt="Styleguide thumbnails go here!">

            <h1> I wanted the portfolio section to look more like a catalogue, something you would see on Steam or Epic Games library, just to give it that game feel. Additionally, I wanted it to be more experimental and abstract than the rest of my site. </h1>

               I will be honest I am thoroughly disappointed in the way this submission turned out, I think a large portion of what I intially wanted to acheive was lost due a lack of time management and also a loss of motivation. I take full responsibility and I suppose this is a prime example of you live and you learn. I was really excited for this assignment because I had done a bit of research into three.js and making a fully interactive website, and I was so hyped to implement it into my website but unfortunately I was not able to pull it off in the end. So my plan B was to include several projects made with Javascript because I was stumped in terms of what JS I could include in the website because there was so much content and it felt almost suffocating. I then decided to shift my focus to several JS projects: a weather app, an html game and a drawing app. Needless to say due to time constraints and procrastination, I could only include a game and the weather app, and I would have coupled it with a quiz. And that did not work out either. I think I learnt a hard lesson here, and that's that programming is not easy but the problem solving gets easier the more you do it.
